#Deep Learning Lung Cancer Care App
The following repository contains my FYP named Artificial INTELLIGENCE LUNG CANCER CARE APP i.e AALCCA. The project identifies the problem in Healthcare,it takes the initiatives to solve the delayed responses of lung cancer detecion,maintaining the metrics of more accurate cancer detection at early stage,making it ease for both the radiologists,oncologists, medical staff and general public.It leverages AI and it's revolutionized Deep Learning and it's model for detection and classification of cancer.
I had classified lung cancer into three main classes which are normal,benign and malignant.The Dataset is of publicly available and thus we collected data from repositories and unified the data house.We had tested four deep learning models for this purpose that includes Mobilenet,Resnet,V-NEt and VGG16.Among them VGG16 qualifies in terms of accuracy, reliability and compatibility to application intent functionality.The app not only resolves Cancer problem in medical area,it also raise act as influencer to raise awareness for LungCancer Awareness and making it easy to use for users by user friendly environment and accessible user based features.
